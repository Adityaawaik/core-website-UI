# React + Vite

# <a href='https://adityaawaik.github.io/core-website-UI/'> Core website </a>

# About 

A responsive dashboard UI built using modern frontend technologies. The project demonstrates reusable components, responsive layout handling, and clean UI structure suitable for admin or HR management systems.

# Assumption Made 

<p>The project focuses only on UI implementation (no backend integration).</p>
<p>Static data is used to demonstrate layout and interactions.</p>
<p>Design is optimized primarily for desktop and tablet, with responsive handling for mobile.</p>
<p>Sidebar navigation and burger menu behaviour are implemented for UI demonstration purposes.</p>
<p>This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.</p>



Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
